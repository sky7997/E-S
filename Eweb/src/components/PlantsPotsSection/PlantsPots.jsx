            A nursery is a place where rooting of planting materials or germination of seeds can be obtained in a better way, 
            under favourable growing conditions. In a nursery, seeds germinate effectively and seedlings give better stand in field.
            The nursery improves germination and colonization, saves time, space, labor and facilitates maintenance.
